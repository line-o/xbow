# xBow

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/line-o/xbow.svg)](https://travis-ci.com/line-o/xbow)

Xquery helper function library to be used with the arrow operator.
Should be read as **crossbow**, a tool to shoot arrows fast and accurately.

## Usage

The library provides a small number of useful functions when working with the
arrow operator with sequences or sequences in general.

Install the [XAR](https://github.com/line-o/xbow/releases/) and

    import module namespace xbow="http://line-o.de/xq/xbow";

Below you'll find some key things xbow has to offer.
For more, have a look at the
[examples](https://github.com/line-o/xbow/tree/master/test) and
[tests](https://github.com/line-o/xbow/tree/master/test).

Even if the module was developed with arrow expressions in mind,
all of it can be used without this language feature, as well.

## Requirements

- xquery version 3.1+
- existdb version 4.7.0+

## Accessors

Many of the functions in this module have a second signature, expecting an accessor function.
This concept was inspired by [D3](https://d3js.org), since it is an excellent tool to mangle data.

The idea is that you tell the operation you want to perform how to retrieve the value it should 
operate on. 
Maybe you want to filter user elements by let's sey their karma points property, but you do not want to lose
the elements itself in the process. Then, passing an accessor to the comparison function would
do the trick.
Since the key function (or accessor) knows how to deal with the datatype of your
sequence items, most operations can be used on atomics, nodes, maps and arrays. 
All `item()*` welcome.

In the section [Grouping](#Grouping) is a code example.

There are two functions, `xbow:pluck` and `xbow:pluck-deep`, that can help making use of accessors.
The second example in [Filtering](#Filtering) uses pluck.

## Filtering

```xquery
(0 to 9) => filter(xbow:gt(4)) => filter(xbow:lt(6))
```

The above code outputs 5 since all numbers less and greater were filtered out.

`xbow` implements the usual comparison functions `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `le`, `gt` and `ge`.

They all return a function, so that they can be used in combination with filter and
for-each. They all accept an [accessor](#Accessors) as a second argument.

Here it is in action (this time using an array as input):

```xquery
[
  map { 'a': 1, 'b': 2 },
  map { 'a': 2, 'b': 1 },
  map { 'a': 3, 'b': 1 }
] 
    => array:filter(xbow:eq(1, xbow:pluck('b')))
    => array:for-each(xbow:pluck('a'))
    (: yields (2, 3) :)
```

## Grouping

Grouping items after an arrow would require some boilerplate code.
This is where `xbow:groupBy` comes in handy.

```xquery
(
  <user first='Mike' last='Hill'/>,
  <user first='Paula' last='Moon'/>,
  <user first='Carla' last='Harlowe'/>,
  <user first='Fela' last='Kuti'/>
)
  => xbow:groupBy(function ($item as element()) {
      substring($item/@last, 1, 1) })
```

The second parameter is an accessor function. A concept shamelessly copied from [D3](https://d3js.org).


The function will always return a map. It will have all items of the input sequence.
Any value produced by the accessor function, will be a key in the resulting map.

```xquery
map {
  'H': (
    <user first='Mike' last='Hill'/>,
    <user first='Carla' last='Harlowe'/>
  )
  'M': <user first='Paula' last='Moon'/>,
  'K': <user first='Fela' last='Kuti'/>
}
```

## Sorting

This is just a small wrapper around the normal sort function.
Mainly, to not have to remember to add an empty sequence,
if you just want to use a sorting function.

This will sort numerical entries in descending order.

```xquery
(0, 3, 9, 8) => xbow:descending(?)
```

Returns `(9, 8, 3, 0)`


Using `fn:sort` produces the same output.

```xquery
(0, 3, 9, 8) => sort((), function ($a) { -$a })
```

## Folding

`fold-left`, `fold-right`

Sometimes you want to test a sequence of items if all, some or
none of them meet a certain condition.

### All

`xbow:all` returns true, if the testing function returns `true()` for _each item_.

```xquery
(1 to 4) => xbow:all(xbow:lt(5))
```

### Some

`xbow:some` returns true, if the testing function returns `true()` for _at least one item_.

```xquery
('1', '2', '3') => xbow:some(xbow:eq('2'))
```

### None

`xbow:none` returns true, if the testing function returns `false()` for _each item_.

```xquery
(['1', '1'], ['1', '2'], ['1', '3']) => xbow:none(xbow:eq('2', xbow:pluck(1)))
```

## Nodes

There is a number of functions to output or operate on nodes, attributes and elements.

For example:
Wrapping a single value in an element of a certain type with `wrap-element` or
each item in a sequence (`wrap-each`).

```xquery
(1 to 3) 
  => xbow:wrap-each('item')
  => xbow:wrap-element('root')
```

outputs

```xml
<root>
  <item>1</item>
  <item>2</item>
  <item>3</item>
</root>
```


## General Arrow Syntax

Remember:

```xquery
  (0 to 9) => sum(),
  (0 to 9) => sum(?)
  (0 to 9) => (function($a) { sum($a) })()
```
is fine

but `(0 to 9) => sum(.)`
or `(0 to 9) => sum#1`
or `(0 to 9) => function ($a) { sum($a) }`
all **throw**!

## Roadmap / TODOs

- [x] Add convenience functions for boolean tests on sequence items
    (`all`, `none`, `some`) 
- [ ] Rename xbow:map-reverse (to xbow:map-flip for example)
- [ ] Change namespace to `xb` for brevity
- [ ] Test/support elements with namespaces in `wrap*`

- [ ] More examples
- [ ] Extend documentation on concepts
- [ ] Generate xqdoc Documentation at build

- [ ] Replace `ant` with `gulp-exist` +watcher 
- [ ] Create packages for other XQuery runtimes

## Known Issues

The xBow module is only tested on and distributed for [eXist-db](https://eXist-db.org) at the moment. In theory the core library module should run 
anywhere. It depends on functions only available in xquery version 3.1 (or higher).

The released package requires existdb 4.7.0 or higher, due to a bug that caused
unpredictable behaviour when using `xbow:wrap-element` and related functions (see [original issue](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/issues/1960) for details).

We are trading readability, maintainability and comfort for speed with this module.
FLOWR-expressions are well optimized and execute at least twice as fast.
This module will only really shine when the runtime is able to parallelize function calls and would
also benefit heavily from lazy evaluation.
